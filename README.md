![Frame-6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100711150/156599850-3de0cefb-0a05-4966-870b-9ac343cf286a.jpg)


## What is this?

Dear website owners: if you put this little script into your site, it will show an awareness popup to Russian visitors. Many official sites might be currently blocked, but yours isnâ€™t. Many Russians already know, but some might need a nudge. Note: This will not block Russian visitors from your page. Click anywhere and the popup closes.


**Just add the following snippet before ```</body>``` tag of your page.**  
```html
<script defer src="https://helptheukrainenow.newnow.cool/helptheukrainenow.js"></script>
```

It says:  
**Russians: Your government is lying to you about Ukraine. Innocent people and children are being killed!**    
Please find a way to learn the truth from family, friends or from news outside of Russia!
